## How to Play 1Win Aviator

1Win Aviator is a very simple game to play. The game starts with a plane
taking off. The plane will then fly higher and higher, and the
multiplier will increase. Your goal is to cash out before the plane
crashes. If you cash out too early, you will not win anything. If you
cash out too late, the plane will crash and you will lose your bet.

There are two ways to cash out in 1Win Aviator:

-   Manually: You can click the "Cash Out" button at any time to
    cash out your winnings.
-   Automatically: You can set a "Auto Cash Out" amount. When the
    multiplier reaches your set amount, your winnings will be
    automatically cashed out.
